# Autonomous Robot Simulation with Advanced Navigation Algorithms

## Overview
This project involves the **programming and simulation of an autonomous robot** with advanced navigation capabilities. Utilizing **Kalman Filters, odometry, and differential kinematics**, the system ensures accurate and efficient movement. Additionally, **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), sensor fusion, and probability theory** are implemented for robust sensor data interpretation and precise mapping.
